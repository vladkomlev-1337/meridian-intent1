# Memory-Guided Pipeline (`pipeline=memory_guided`)

`pipeline=memory_guided` is the guided mutation DAG plus external memory-card
retrieval. It reads cards; it does not decide write cadence.

Use it when the mutation suggester should see cross-run memory cards:

```bash
python run.py problem.name=heilbron pipeline=memory_guided memory=reader \
  checkpoint_dir=/data/banks/heilbron
```

For read + write against one shared bank during the same run:

```bash
python run.py problem.name=heilbron pipeline=memory_guided memory=full memory/write=live
```

Use a separate memory LLM when card research/writing should run on a cheaper
or instruct-tuned endpoint:

```bash
python run.py problem.name=heilbron \
  pipeline=memory_guided memory=full memory/write=live \
  memory/llm=qwen_instruct \
  checkpoint_dir=/data/banks/heilbron
```

For a pre-built shared bank with an end-of-run refresh:

```bash
python run.py problem.name=heilbron pipeline=memory_guided memory=full \
  checkpoint_dir=/data/banks/heilbron
```

## Evaluation metadata and uncertainty

The standard `guided` and `memory_guided` pipelines consume reserved validator
artifact namespaces and place their contents on `program.metadata`; reserved
data never enters mutation prompts. `artifact["_program_metadata"]` carries
arbitrary evaluator-owned metadata such as `per_sample_scores` for the paired
archive selector. `artifact["_evaluation_measurements"]` carries typed scalar
uncertainty, for example:

```python
return metrics, {
    "_evaluation_measurements": {
        "fitness": {
            "sample_sd": cv_score_std,
            "n": len(fold_scores),
            "method": "cross_validation",
        }
    }
}
```

The validator stage binds the measurement to `metrics["fitness"]`, stores it on
the program, and converts `sample_sd / sqrt(n)` to a standard error when Memory
V2 records the child-versus-parent outcome. Validators may instead provide a
direct non-negative `se`. Missing measurements preserve the ordinary
`se=None` path.

## DAG Contract

`MemoryContextStage` selects cards through `memory.provider` and feeds them only
to `MutationSuggestionStage.memory_cards`. Raw memory cards do not go directly
into `MutationContextStage.memory`; the mutation agent sees structured
suggestions produced from the cards.

The per-parent history summary still feeds `MutationContextStage.memory`, same
as `pipeline=guided`.

## Advanced Controls

These are experiment and prompt-placement controls. Most users should leave
them at defaults.

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| `pipeline_builder.fresh_context_reorder` | `true` | Select cards using the fresh parent-history summary and current evolutionary stats from this DAG pass. `false` uses older metadata context. |
| `pipeline_builder.reverse_repack` | `false` | Reverse rendered card order so the strongest selected card is closest to the final instruction. |
| `pipeline_builder.no_card_control_probability` | `0.10` | Withhold selected cards from this fraction of otherwise card-eligible mutations to create fair no-card controls for reputation. |
| `pipeline_builder.memory_block_last` | `false` | Move the memory block later in the mutation context, closer to the final mutation instruction. |

## Read/Write Split

Reading cards:

```bash
pipeline=memory_guided memory=reader checkpoint_dir=/data/banks/task
```

Writing cards:

```bash
pipeline=guided memory=writer checkpoint_dir=/data/banks/task
```

Reading and writing:

```bash
pipeline=memory_guided memory=full checkpoint_dir=/data/banks/task
```

Live writing:

```bash
pipeline=memory_guided memory=full memory/write=live checkpoint_dir=/data/banks/task
```

JSON-document genomes compose with the same memory pipeline:

```bash
pipeline=memory_guided program_format=json_document \
  memory=full memory/write=live checkpoint_dir=/data/banks/chains
```
