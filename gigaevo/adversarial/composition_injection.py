"""CompositionInjectionHook: Lamarckian transfer via D ∘ G code composition.

After each generation, iterates ALL G programs in G's archive. For each G,
looks up the best D for that specific G (via DGImprovementTracker). If the
(D, G) pair has not been injected before, composes a new G program whose
entrypoint() returns D(G()) and adds it to G's storage. The pair is then
permanently marked as injected — never composed again.

Composition is CODE-level, not data-level: G's code is renamed to
_g_entrypoint, D's code is renamed to _d_entrypoint, and a new entrypoint()
chains them. MAP-Elites evaluates the result; no pre-check on fitness.

If no D-improvement is recorded for any G in the archive, no programs are
injected this iteration.

Tagged with mutation_type="d_improvement" for lineage tracking.
This is the Lamarckian transfer mechanism for Arm A.
