"""Adversarial-specific canonical events.

Subclasses of `BaseEvent` that describe adversarial-coevolution emission sites:
- TRACKER_WRITE — DGImprovementTracker finishes a batch write
- HOF_FETCH     — opponent HoF loaded from Redis for sampling
- HOF_ROTATE    — opponent HoF size/content changed between DAG steps
- CELL_PICK     — CellStratified opponent provider picked one elite per cell

Role-invariant validators (constructor G vs improver D expectations) attach
directly to the relevant events via Pydantic `@field_validator` /
`@model_validator` decorators. The general log auditor does NOT hold these
invariants — events validate themselves on construction.
