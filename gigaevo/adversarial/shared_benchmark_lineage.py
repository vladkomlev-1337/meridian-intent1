"""Shared-benchmark filter for D-side LineageStage.

Rationale
---------
D's LineageStage narrates parent-D → child-D fitness transitions to the
mutation LLM. In adversarial co-evolution with a rotating G Hall-of-Fame
the raw whole-eval deltas are apples-to-oranges: parent and child are
usually scored against different G's. This stage subclasses LineageStage
and overrides ``preprocess()`` to:

  1) Filter out parents that share fewer than ``min_shared`` evaluation
     opponents with the child (``tracker.metrics_by_d`` key intersection).
  2) Re-run the population's aggregation logic on the per-opponent records
     restricted to the shared-G subset, via an injected
     :class:`MetricsAggregator`. The aggregator returns a dict whose schema
     matches ``program.metrics`` — so ``MetricsFormatter`` can render it
     into the prompt without a ``KeyError``.

Aggregator DI contract
----------------------
The aggregator is required (``aggregator=None`` ⇒ ``ValueError``). It is
the single validity gate: every per-opponent record in the shared-G subset
is forwarded to it, invalid entries and all; the aggregator's
``metrics_context.is_valid`` decides what to keep.

``per_metric_shared_count`` uses ``len(shared_opponent_ids)`` as a uniform
denominator for every aggregator output key. Per-metric filtering is
owned by the aggregator, keeping that detail out of
``TransitionEvidence``.

Installation
------------
:class:`AdversarialAsymmetricPipelineBuilder` installs this on D runs only
via ``replace_stage("LineageStage", ...)``. Node name stays
``"LineageStage"`` so downstream edges are preserved.

Future work
-----------
G-side analog deferred — see ``experiments/IDEAS.yaml``:
``heilbron-g-side-lineage-filter``.
