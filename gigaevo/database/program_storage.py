    Shared across all collector instances via ``storage.snapshot``.
    Call :meth:`bump` at phase boundaries to invalidate; collectors that
    see a stale epoch will re-fetch exactly once (others piggyback).

    Supports two invalidation modes:

    * **Full** (``bump()``): clears cached data, forcing a complete refetch.
      Use when program *data* (metrics, lineage) may have changed.
    * **Incremental** (``bump(incremental=True)``): preserves cached data and
      only fetches new/removed programs on the next ``get_all``.  Use when
      only program *states* (set membership) changed — not data fields that
      the caller reads.

    Single-slot cache keyed on ``(epoch, exclude)``. Works correctly when all
    callers within an epoch use the same exclude value (which is true in practice:
    EvolutionaryStatisticsCollector always uses exclude={"stage_results", "metadata"}, all
    other callers use exclude=None). If a new caller with a different exclude
    value is added, the cache will thrash with no benefits -- a latent hazard
    that would require a dict-based multi-slot cache to fully address.
