"""Parent refresh — the only post-seed DONE→QUEUED path under the
steady-state engine.

A producer task selects parents from the archive, then asks the
:class:`ParentRefresher` to:

1. Expand the parent set via a :class:`ParentRefreshSelector` (default:
   direct parents only; future implementations may walk lineage).
2. Flip every selected program from DONE → QUEUED (in one batch transition,
   so no producer sees a half-flipped parent bundle).
3. Wait until every flipped program is DONE again (re-evaluated by the
   DAG runner).
4. Return the freshly-evaluated :class:`Program` objects.

Concurrent producers that happen to select overlapping parents are
serialised on a per-parent-id :class:`asyncio.Lock` so a parent is never
double-flipped.

Failure semantics: if any parent ends up DISCARDED or vanishes during the
refresh wait, the helper raises :class:`ValueError`; the caller aborts
that mutant (releases its in-flight slot) rather than fall back to stale
state.

    The ticket carries:

      * Per-parent-id ``asyncio.Lock`` instances, held in deterministic
        sorted-by-id order at the time the ticket was issued.

    Ownership contract: whoever holds the ticket MUST call :meth:`release`
    exactly once. ``release()`` is idempotent — calling it twice is a no-op
    rather than an error — which lets handoff points (mutant_task →
    ingestor) double-release defensively without corrupting the lock state.

    The locks are released in reverse acquisition order to avoid waking
    contention on later locks before earlier ones, matching the unwind
    order of the original ``_acquire_all`` context manager.

    This object is hand-off cooperative: a producer task can refresh,
    register the resulting child in ``_in_flight``, and store the ticket
    on the engine for the ingestor to release once the child reaches
    DONE/DISCARDED. That extends the lock-hold scope from "refresh only"
