        Releases ``_buffer_sema`` slots that a mutant cancelled between
        ``_in_flight.add`` and the slot release would otherwise leak —
        ``mutant_task``'s ``finally`` guards ``slot_transferred=True`` and
        refuses to release, expecting the ingestor to. On normal completion
        the DAG may still be flipping QUEUED→RUNNING→DONE for the last few
        in-flight mutants, so we sleep between empty passes instead of giving
        up immediately, bounded by ``deadline_seconds``.

        Cancellation semantics: each ``poll_and_ingest`` pass is wrapped in
        an explicit :class:`asyncio.Task` so we can wait for it (briefly) to
        finish if our awaiter is cancelled. A bare ``asyncio.shield`` would
        let the inner task become detached on cancellation, where it would
        race ``_post_run_hook.on_run_complete`` and the engine teardown for
        access to ``storage`` and ``_in_flight``. Instead we cancel and
        await the inner on a best-effort timeout — the inner's cancel
        cleanup latency caps the wall-clock cost, not the timeout
        parameter; ``wait_for`` returns only once the inner is terminal,
        guaranteeing no zombie coroutine outlives this method. After the

        the caller's teardown order is preserved (the ``BaseException``
        family — ``KeyboardInterrupt``, ``SystemExit`` — propagates
        intact; we only swallow ``Exception`` from the cleanup wait).
