MUTATION_MEMORY_ASSIGNMENT_METADATA_KEY = "memory_assignment"

#: Durable at-most-once claim for the production MEMORY_OUTCOME row. The first
#: terminal evaluation owns Y; later evaluations are classified as duplicate or
#: MEMORY_OUTCOME_UPDATE without creating a second terminal for the decision.
MUTATION_MEMORY_OUTCOME_METADATA_KEY = "memory_outcome_terminal"

#: Typed failure classification written atomically with a child transition to
#: DISCARDED. Outcome attribution parses this record instead of inferring causal
#: eligibility from the generic program state.
MUTATION_TERMINAL_FAILURE_METADATA_KEY = "mutation_terminal_failure"

#: Child-birth snapshot of every parent's durable read assignment, keyed by
#: parent id. This is authoritative for crossover attribution.
MUTATION_MEMORY_PARENT_ASSIGNMENTS_METADATA_KEY = "memory_parent_assignments"

#: Child-birth map from each delivered card id to its source parent decision and
#: context. Original ids remain keys so later absorbed-id aliasing stays resolvable.
MUTATION_MEMORY_CARD_PROVENANCE_METADATA_KEY = "memory_card_provenance"

#: Mutation-level audit assignment for the full delivered slate across parents.
MUTATION_MEMORY_MUTATION_ASSIGNMENT_METADATA_KEY = "memory_mutation_assignment"

#: Frozen onto a child at birth: sorted union of the parents' prompt-time
#: selected card ids. Posterior attribution reads this stamp — the parents'
#: own selected-ids metadata is overwritten on every NO_CACHE requeue, so it
#: cannot be trusted at sweep time. Empty list means "born without cards";
#: absent means legacy program (fall back to parents' current slates).
MUTATION_MEMORY_INJECTED_IDS_METADATA_KEY = "memory_injected_idea_ids"

#: Bool stamped on a child at birth: whether any card was in its mutation prompt.
MUTATION_MEMORY_USED_METADATA_KEY = "memory_used"

#: Frozen onto a child at birth: sorted transitive closure of every card revision
#: blocked from this branch. This includes cards actually applied and randomized
#: probes in both treated and control arms, so delayed outcomes compare symmetric
#: downstream policies. Read by the lineage card-excluder.
MUTATION_MEMORY_LINEAGE_BLOCKED_IDS_METADATA_KEY = "memory_lineage_blocked_ids"

#: Structured mutation output (archetype, changes) stamped on a child program's
#: metadata by the mutation operator (``MutationSpec.META_OUTPUT``).
MUTATION_OUTPUT_METADATA_KEY = "mutation_output"

#: Per-mutation Thompson-auction record: one entry per candidate card offered to
#: the auction (card_id, posterior a/b, draws, baseline arm, selected). Written
#: even when zero cards win, so the offline lifecycle analysis can see which
#: candidates were rejected (the "no-card" outcome).
MUTATION_MEMORY_CANDIDATE_SLATE_METADATA_KEY = "memory_candidate_slate"

#: Legacy/base-parent selected ids frozen at birth. Current attribution prefers
#: MUTATION_MEMORY_INJECTED_IDS_METADATA_KEY (the full prompt slate across all
#: parents) so crossover donor cards can be credited; this key still supplies a
#: base-parent fallback for older children.
MUTATION_MEMORY_BASE_SELECTED_IDS_METADATA_KEY = "memory_base_selected_idea_ids"

#: Frozen onto a child at birth: the base parent's metric dict — the decision context
#: and the reward baseline (base_fitness = base_metrics[fitness_key], derived at the
#: write seam where fitness_key is known).
MUTATION_MEMORY_BASE_METRICS_METADATA_KEY = "memory_base_metrics"

#: Frozen onto a child at birth: the base parent's program id — the decision-context
#: parent identity that accompanies base_metrics through use-attribution.
MUTATION_MEMORY_BASE_ID_METADATA_KEY = "memory_base_id"

#: Frozen onto a child at birth: the base parent's per-sample score vector
#: (``per_sample_scores`` metadata), when the eval emits one. Coherent with the
#: frozen base_metrics — the parent's own vector is overwritten on re-eval, so
#: paired crediting must read the child's stamp. Absent when the eval is
#: scalar-only; crediting degrades to the exact point delta.
MUTATION_MEMORY_BASE_SCORES_METADATA_KEY = "memory_base_scores"

#: Ordered evaluation-cohort digest aligned with ``memory_base_scores``.
MUTATION_MEMORY_BASE_SCORE_SIGNATURE_METADATA_KEY = "memory_base_score_signature"

#: Frozen evaluator-reported uncertainty for the base parent's metrics. The
#: child's own evaluation measurements may be refreshed on re-evaluation, so
#: child-vs-base credit must retain the exact measurement paired with the
#: frozen ``memory_base_metrics`` snapshot.
MUTATION_MEMORY_BASE_EVALUATION_MEASUREMENTS_METADATA_KEY = (
    "memory_base_evaluation_measurements"
)

#: Frozen onto a child at birth: per parent, the cache id of every parent stage
#: output that produced the child (outputs live content-addressed in the storage
#: stage-output store). Survives the parent's NO_CACHE stages being overwritten
#: on re-selection/re-eval. Maps parent_id -> {stage_name: cache_id}.
