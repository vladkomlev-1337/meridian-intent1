"""Scheduling abstractions for controlling DAG evaluation order.

Provides pluggable feature extractors, eval-time predictors, and
program prioritizers.  The default (FIFO) preserves existing behavior;
LPT (Longest Processing Time first) scheduling reduces tail idle time
by starting predicted-longest jobs first.

Quick start::

    from gigaevo.evolution.scheduling import (
        LPTPrioritizer,
        SimpleHeuristicPredictor,
        CodeFeatureExtractor,
    )

    predictor = SimpleHeuristicPredictor()
    prioritizer = LPTPrioritizer(predictor)

    # In DagRunner: sorted_programs = prioritizer.prioritize(candidates)
    # After eval:   prioritizer.predictor.update(program, actual_duration)
