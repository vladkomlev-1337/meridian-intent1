"""Novelty-admission agent: a single LangGraph LLM hop gating idea-card writes.

Given one authored insight card and the task baked into its system prompt, the
judge answers a single question: would a strong optimizer LLM already reach for
this lever unprompted on this task? If yes, the card restates the mutator's own
prior and is inert — it is rejected before it enters the bank. If no, it carries
a lever the mutator would not otherwise apply, and it is kept.

This is a NOVELTY-vs-prior test, not a quality or correctness test: a card can be
sound advice yet be rejected for being obvious, and a non-obvious card is kept
even if it is wrong (the mutator's own prior corrects a stray wrong card in
practice). Structured output is bound at construction via
``with_structured_output`` so the router negotiates the method (do not force
``function_calling``).
