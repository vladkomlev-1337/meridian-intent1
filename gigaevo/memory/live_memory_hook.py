"""Live mid-run refresh hook for the MemoryWriter / external-memory pipeline.

Wraps a :class:`MemoryWriter` instance as a ``post_step_hook`` so the global
memory bank is rebuilt mid-run instead of only once after ``on_run_complete``.

Cadence is counted in *ingestor sweeps that landed at least one program* —
the steady-state engine has no notion of "generations", and the ingestor only
fires its post-step hook when ``added > 0`` (see
``gigaevo/evolution/engine/ingestor.py``). One sweep ≈ one ingest of a fresh
batch of mutants, so this approximates "every K newly-evaluated programs".

The hook signature matches what :class:`EvolutionEngine` expects::

    Callable[[], Awaitable[None]]

Fault isolation, wall-clock bounds and cancel-grace are provided by the
engine's ``_run_bounded_post_step_hook`` wrapper. This class logs each refresh
failure on its own channel (with a consecutive-failure count, so a silently
dying memory bank is attributable from the run log) and re-raises — the engine
keeps owning fault isolation.
