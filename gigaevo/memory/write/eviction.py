"""Write-side eviction surface over the card bank.

The write path must not import the read system. The ``Evictor`` protocol and
``foreign_retention_veto`` are the eviction surface consumed by the admission
gate's periodic sweep. ``NullEvictor`` disables write-side eviction (the
``memory=none`` path), the bank-maintenance twin of disabled memory on the read
side. ``memory=v2`` wires its causal retirement policy through this seam.
