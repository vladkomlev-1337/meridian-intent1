    modeled MAP-Elites context in which its lineage was proposed. For retirement,
    "helpful" means clearing a low quantile of the task ledger's own non-zero
    randomized-control gain magnitudes; the read policy still evaluates ordinary
    helpfulness relative to zero.

    Verdicts are deliberately one-shot. ``CardAdmissionGate.sweep`` computes
    them and immediately revalidates the exact card revision before deletion.
