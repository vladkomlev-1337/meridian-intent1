"""Canonical-event emission helper.

Single point of truth for converting a validated `BaseEvent` into a structured
loguru log line in the `[EVENT_NAME] {json}` format that `log_audit.py`
already parses.

Records carry `extra["canonical_event"] = True` so sinks that emit follow-up
events (notably the EXCEPTION sink) can skip canonical-event lines and avoid
infinite recursion.

Track B4 — Redis minute-bucket counters
---------------------------------------
When `configure_event_counters(client, prefix)` is called once at process
start, every `emit()` additionally INCRs ``{prefix}:events:{event}:{minute}``
with a week-long TTL. The INCR is silent: no loguru line, failures swallowed,
and `emit()` never raises on Redis trouble. The watchdog reads these counters
to fire the generic `EVENT_RATE_ZERO` alert when a registered event with
``expected_after_gen > 0`` has produced zero emissions past its threshold.
