"""General canonical-events registry.

Events are Pydantic subclasses of `BaseEvent`. Subclassing a concrete event
(one with a non-empty `event: ClassVar[str]`) auto-registers the class in
`CANONICAL_EVENTS` via `__init_subclass__`. There is no central list to
maintain — defining a subclass IS registration.

This module is role-agnostic: no G/D labels, no adversarial-specific fields.
Experiments tag their runs via the optional `run_label` field; downstream
tooling (e.g. the `gigaevo events plot` CLI) groups by user-supplied regex.

Adversarial-specific events (TRACKER_WRITE, HOF_FETCH, HOF_ROTATE, CELL_PICK)
live in `gigaevo.adversarial.events` so they can carry role-invariant
validators without polluting the general registry.

Emission seams (each event has exactly one):
- EXCEPTION           -> loguru exception sink hook
- STAGE_EXEC          -> Stage.__call__ base-class wrapper
- LLM_CALL            -> LLM client request/response wrapper
- METRIC_EMIT         -> metric logging helper
- BACKPRESSURE_SAMPLE -> backpressure_sampler periodic tick

``GENERATION_BOUNDARY`` is parse-only — its Pydantic schema is retained so
``log_audit`` can validate archived run logs, but no current code path
emits it.
