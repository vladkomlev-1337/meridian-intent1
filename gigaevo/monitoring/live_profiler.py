"""Live flow-profiler daemon — periodically re-render the running log to HTML.

Drops a single helper into ``run.py`` so you can watch ``profile_live.html``
in a browser while the experiment is mutating. The thread is daemonic
(no graceful shutdown is required — process exit kills it) and every
render iteration is fully self-contained, so a parsing error on one tick
never poisons the next.

Usage::

    from gigaevo.monitoring.live_profiler import start_live_profiler
    start_live_profiler(log_path, out_dir, interval_s=60)

The HTML is written atomically (``.tmp`` then ``os.replace``) so a
browser that reloads mid-write never sees a half-flushed file.

    Parameters:
        log_path: path to the loguru log file the run is writing to.
        out_dir: directory in which to place the rendered HTML (created if
            it does not exist).
        label: short identifier used in the page title and div id.
        interval_s: seconds between re-renders. 60s is a good default —
            parsing a 70MB log takes ~1s and the page is fully usable
            without redraw.
        filename: output filename inside ``out_dir``.
        last_n: initial y-axis window size. Only the most recent
            ``last_n`` programs are shown on page open; toolbar buttons
            allow widening or showing all. Pass ``None`` to disable
