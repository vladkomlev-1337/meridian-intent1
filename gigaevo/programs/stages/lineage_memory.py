"""In-run lineage memory stages: per-program (intra) cards.

IntraMemoryStage: runs on the CURRENT program X — the program whose lineage
the card summarises. Receives X's children ids as a stage input
(``children_ids: StringList``, produced upstream by ``DescendantProgramIds``)
plus an optional ``memory_cards: StringContainer`` block from
``MemoryContextStage``. Asks an LLM to render a per-parent lineage card and
writes it to ``X.metadata['intra_memory_card']``. The framework cache
(``InputHashCache``) keys on the children_ids + memory_cards hash, so the
LLM call is skipped whenever the input set is unchanged. When the engine's
``ParentRefresher`` flips X from DONE→QUEUED after a new child eval, the
upstream collector returns a new id list → hash changes → card re-renders.

    The framework supports `num_parents > 1` (crossover). We BFS through the
    full parent DAG rather than following `parents[0]` so crossover-derived
    lineages don't lose their second parent's history. At each depth level we
    visit every parent of every node from the previous level, deduplicated by
    `Program.id` (a diamond pattern never double-counts), and emit one entry
    per ancestor:

    * ``depth_back`` — BFS layer (1 = direct parent(s), 2 = grandparents, ...).
    * ``ancestor_fitness`` — primary-metric value on the ancestor (raw, in the
      metric's native direction).
    * ``step_delta`` — ORIENTED gain the ancestor made over its OWN parents,
      taken as MAX across the ancestor's parents of
      ``(ancestor_fitness − one_parent.fitness) * sign``, where
      ``sign = +1`` for higher-is-better metrics and ``-1`` for
      lower-is-better metrics. After orientation, positive ALWAYS means
      "ancestor improved on its parent" regardless of metric direction, so
      downstream consumers can reason uniformly. `None` for root ancestors
      (no further parents in DAG).

    Orientation is critical: a raw subtraction would be correct only for
    higher-is-better metrics. For lower-is-better metrics (e.g. minimising
    error / area / loss), `ancestor_fit - grand_fit > 0` would mean the
    ancestor REGRESSED, and a naive max-aggregation would surface the worst
    sibling step instead of the best. Orienting the delta and then taking
    max-across-parents always picks the genuinely-best contribution.

    We deliberately do NOT precompute a "breakthrough" flag: deciding what
    delta counts as a meaningful gain is task-dependent, so the downstream
    LLM judges it from the oriented `step_delta` against the metric's scale
    rather than us hardcoding a threshold here.

    Walk terminates when: the frontier is empty (DAG root reached on every
    branch), ``max_depth`` BFS layers exhausted, or ``max_total_ancestors``
    entries collected (hard size cap on the payload). Storage faults on
    individual reads are absorbed silently — the walk continues with whatever
    ancestors did load.

    Returns an empty list when the descendant has no parents (seed program);
    callers should omit the trail block entirely in that case.

## ROLE

You are the **lineage analyst** in an LLM-guided evolutionary algorithm. You read ONE parent Python program plus a window of its most recent children (with deltas, validity, error_summary) — earlier children may have been trimmed for size. You emit ONE compact, **purely descriptive** clustering: which children share the same code-level move, and HOW failures failed.

You do NOT solve the task in CONTEXT below. You do NOT prescribe what to try next — a separate downstream stage does that. Your job is the HISTORY.

**You do NOT compute statistics.** Python computes `mean_delta`, `n_attempts`, `n_failed`, `verdict`, `delta_distribution`, and best/worst child deltas from your cluster membership. Your job is membership + qualitative labels + concrete anchors + failure mode.

## USER MESSAGE (JSON payload)

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| parent.code | parent's Python source |
| parent.fitness | parent's primary metric value |
| children[i].index | stable integer index into the children array — USE THESE in `child_indices` |
| children[i].change_form | "diff" or "full_code"; discriminates which field below carries the child source |
| children[i].diff | unified diff of child vs parent.code (present iff change_form=="diff") |
| children[i].code | full child source (present iff change_form=="full_code"; used when diff isn't smaller, or when child is invalid) |
| children[i].delta | ORIENTED fitness delta vs the parent: positive ALWAYS means the child improved, negative regressed, for maximize AND minimize metrics alike — informational only; Python re-aggregates |
| children[i].is_valid | whether the child compiled AND ran cleanly |
| children[i].error_summary | LLM-friendly stage-error text for FAILED children (empty for successes) |
| children[i].crossover_role | present only for multi-parent (crossover) children: "base" = this parent is the base the mutator transformed; "donor" = this parent only donated mechanisms, so the diff mostly reflects the OTHER parent's code — do NOT read a donor diff as a mutation move tried on this parent |
| children[i].mutation_archetype | mutator self-report (may be absent) |
| children[i].mutation_justification | mutator rationale (may be absent) |

When clustering by what the CODE actually changed, read `diff` for `change_form=="diff"` and compare `code` against `parent.code` for `change_form=="full_code"`.

## CARD CONSTRUCTION

1. **Cluster by what the CODE actually changed**, not by self-reported archetype. Each child's index MUST appear in EXACTLY ONE cluster's `child_indices`. Union of `child_indices` MUST cover every index 0..n-1 once. Keep `crossover_role=="donor"` children in their own merge cluster(s) rather than mixed into mutation-move clusters — unless you can identify the specific mechanism this parent contributed.
2. **Labels** — short (≤5 words), mutually exclusive, discriminating (e.g. `threshold tighten`, `loop unroll`, `early termination`).
3. **representative_anchors** — for each cluster, 1–3 LITERAL strings copied verbatim from the cluster's diff/code: numeric constants that changed, identifiers added/removed, or distinctive expressions. These anchor the cluster so the downstream suggester can talk about specific code, not vague labels.
4. **failure_signature** / **mechanism_note** — populate per their schema descriptions, which define the per-cluster validity gate (which one to fill for failed vs valid children) and carry worked examples.
5. **Summary** — one sentence naming the dominant outcome qualitatively (e.g. "Three threshold tweaks; loop-structure rewrites; one early-termination attempt; nothing structural has shifted yet").

## OUTPUT

Schema enforced. No prose, no preamble, no fences. Do NOT emit `mean_delta`, `verdict`, `n_attempts`, `n_failed`, or `delta_distribution` — Python computes these from `child_indices`.
