"""SteadyStateEvolutionEngine emits BACKPRESSURE_SAMPLE periodically.

Why this matters
----------------
Operators of a running experiment cannot today tell whether ``max_in_flight``
is being utilised — the only published value is the boot banner. The engine
must emit a periodic structured snapshot so a) the live profiler can render a
concurrency-over-time band and b) the canonical-events watchdog can fire if
the engine pegs at the cap for long stretches.

The sampler must:
- Honour ``backpressure_sample_interval`` as its emission cadence (decoupled
  from ``loop_interval`` so a 1Hz engine tick doesn't dump 86k log lines/day).
- Report producer/buffer ``held`` counts derived from
  ``max_in_flight - sema._value`` (the asyncio internal counter is the
  source of truth here).
- Snapshot ``len(_in_flight)`` under ``_in_flight_lock`` so the wire value is
  consistent with the production accounting.
- Tear down cleanly with the other loops in ``run()``'s ``finally``.
