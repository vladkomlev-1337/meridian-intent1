"""Back-compat surface for `EngineConfig` after the two-sema refactor.

Several engine knobs were retired between v1 and v2:

* ``max_mutations_per_generation`` (epoch size — concept gone)
* ``generation_timeout`` (was already a deprecated no-op)
* ``refresh_passes``  (per-epoch archive refresh removed; JIT parent
  refresh handles this now)
* ``refresh_order``   (ordering gone with the per-epoch sweep)
* ``max_elites_per_generation`` (per-generation elite cap — concept gone
  with the generational engine)

External users still carry yaml configs that set these. To avoid breaking
them on upgrade we accept the old keys, drop them silently from the
model, and emit a one-shot ``DeprecationWarning`` per key so the user
sees they are no-ops.

Unknown keys that are NOT in the deprecated allow-list MUST still raise
(``extra='forbid'`` semantics) — that protects against typos like
``max_inflight: 5``.
