"""Deterministic tests for the ghost-persist race in engine mutation generation.

The ghost-persist bug
=====================

In the pre-fix code (``mutation.py`` using ``asyncio.gather(*tasks,
return_exceptions=True)``), the following sequence loses already-persisted
program IDs:

1. ``generate_mutations`` awaits ``asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)``.
2. The single child task ``generate_and_persist_mutation`` runs to the point
   where ``await storage.add(program)`` completes — the program is in Redis.
3. Before the child returns, the engine teardown cancels the *outer*
   coroutine (e.g. by ``task.cancel()`` on the dispatcher's spawned mutant
   task that wraps ``run_one_mutant`` → ``generate_mutations``).
4. ``asyncio.gather`` cancels its children, then re-raises ``CancelledError``
   to its caller. The list of child return values is **never bound** to
   ``results`` — even though the child's ``except BaseException`` handler
   returned ``persisted_id`` as a string, that value is discarded.
5. The program exists in Redis but the engine never sees its ID → ghost
   forever (QUEUED with no in-flight tracker, no ingestor sweep, no DAG
   submission).

These tests reproduce the race deterministically using ``asyncio.Event`` to
synchronise the post-persist moment with the cancellation of the outer
task, and assert that the surviving primitive (``generate_one_mutation``)
returns the ID even when cancelled mid-flight.

After the fix, ``mutant_task`` calls ``generate_one_mutation`` directly —
no ``gather`` wraps the single-mutant path, so the cancellation is raised
inside the child's ``except BaseException`` block which already returns
``persisted_id``. The caller sees the ID and registers it in ``_in_flight``.
