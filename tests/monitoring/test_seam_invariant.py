"""Single-emission-site invariant for canonical events.

Each canonical event has exactly one architectural seam that emits it. Other
code must never bypass that seam by (a) calling `emit()` directly, (b) calling
the adversarial `emit_*` helpers, or (c) forging a canonical-event line with
`logger.info("[EVENT_NAME] ...")`.

This test walks the source tree and flags violations. If a new seam is
legitimately needed, add the file to `ALLOWED_SEAMS` with a comment explaining
which event(s) it emits.
