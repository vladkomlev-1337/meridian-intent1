"""WorkerPool failure-mode tests covering two pool invariants.

1. ``_count`` must NOT be incremented when ``_start_worker_process`` raises.
   If it were, the pool would appear full and all subsequent calls would
   fall through to the one-shot fallback indefinitely.

2. ``return_worker`` must treat ``returncode=0`` (clean exit) as dead —
   the process must be discarded, not re-queued. A re-queued dead worker
   would cause the next caller to receive EOF / BrokenPipe.
